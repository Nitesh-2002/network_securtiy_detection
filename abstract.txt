The goal of the problem is to predict the severity of a network's faults at a given time and location based on the log data available. Each row in the main dataset (train.csv, test.csv) represents a location and a time point. The "id" column, which is the key "id" used in other data files, identifies them. Using “ID” as a primary key we merge other files to make up a full dataset which then was used for data cleaning, Analysis and modelling. A lot of emphasis has been put on data analysis rather than data modelling since, identifying the issue and consequences of fault severity was very important.
